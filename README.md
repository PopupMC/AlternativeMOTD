## Alternative MOTD

Generates my servers MOTD!

```
┇ PopupMC ⬡<splash text here>⬡
┇ Welcome ⬡mcMMO⬡ ⬡SMP⬡ ⬡Economy⬡
```

Minecraft has a long list of splash text that it randomly picks from. This uses that list and removes elements it can't
use. Right now if the list entry is between 1-34 characters it's kept, otherwise removed.

Everytime the MOTD is requested it builds a new MOTD, inserting and colorizing accordingly.

> happened! I just love the vanilla game and I want to embrace it in my server wherever possible and show off the 
> vanilla-ness. I think vanilla MC is greatly underappreciated ^^
